> This project is more than a simulation — it's a miniature tycoon game built inside the Java console.
>
> By modeling customer behavior, dynamic weather effects, satisfaction-driven demand, and research upgrades,  
> it reflects how real-world business logic can be implemented with object-oriented design and clean logic.
