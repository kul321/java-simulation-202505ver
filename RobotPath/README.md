# 🤖 Robot Movement Simulation

A simple Java console application that simulates a robot moving on a 2D grid.  
The robot receives commands and updates its direction and position accordingly.

## 📌 Features

- Represent a robot with position (x, y) and direction (N/E/S/W)
- Move forward in the current direction
- Turn left or right
- Display the current status of the robot
- Console-based interaction

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Compile all `.java` files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## 📁 Files Overview

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Main.java` | Entry point and command input handling |
| `Robot.java` | Handles robot’s state and movement logic |

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to:
- Practice coordinate logic and direction handling
- Simulate real-world robotic movement logic
- Reinforce object-oriented modeling with simple logic
