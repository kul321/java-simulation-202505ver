# 🧙‍♂️ Customizing RPG Character

A console-based simulation for customizing RPG characters and their skills using Java and object-oriented design.  
This project models different character classes, allows for skill assignment, and reflects the structure of an RPG-style character creation system.

## 📌 Features

- Create and manage RPG characters
- Assign class-specific skill sets (e.g. Warrior, Wizard, Archer, etc.)
- Modular class structure with skill inheritance
- Console-based interaction and selection

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Compile all `.java` files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
