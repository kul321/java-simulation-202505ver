A Java console simulation to manage residents living in an apartment complex.  
It handles realistic move-in/out scenarios, including room/floor shifts and edge-based eviction logic.

## ✨ Features
- Register new residents with name and age
- Move residents left/right or upstairs
- Auto-eviction at edge units
- Handles multi-floor structure with logical resident relocation

## ▶ How to Run
```bash
javac Apartment.java
java Apartment
```

## 📁 Files
